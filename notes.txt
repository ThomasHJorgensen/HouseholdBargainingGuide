Questions:

- Why always stay on power grid in solution AND simulation? In practice, too much power is shifted when bargaining happens?
- What is going on with sol->marg_V_couple??

TODO:
- C++:
    - EGM
        - EGM for singles
        - EGM for couples
            - Fix the continuation value thing
                - but how
            - Credit constraint


- Python:
    - Bargaining algo:
        - Verify more thoroughly that results are the same (but it seems to work)
        - Clean up and organize plots
    - EGM
        - EGM for singles
        - EGM for couples


- From note:
    - Check solution + simulation with finer grids
    - Interpolation in simulation? re-use check function? now it is another one. or split the check function to use the index-function.
    - Simulation in C++: is the divorce level of wealth correct? Se lecture 8/9 in course.
        â€“ check also for singles. 
    - Write EGM part such that only discrete choices in outside.
    - Much code is repeated - put into functions
    - Example with re-marriage?
