Questions:

- Why always stay on power grid in solution AND simulation? In practice, too much power is shifted when bargaining happens?
- What is going on with sol->marg_V_couple??

            - Fix the continuation value thing
            - Make sure algortihm works (are we sure A is sufficient statistic?)
            - (Proper algorithm)
            - Credit constraint
